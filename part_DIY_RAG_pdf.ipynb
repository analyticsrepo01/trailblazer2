      "THE BOY WHO LIVED\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\n",
      "that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people\n",
      "you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\n",
      "didn't hold with such nonsense.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\n",
      "drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\n",
      "very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\n",
      "usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\n",
      "time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\n",
      "small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n",
      "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\n",
      "their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they\n",
      "could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing\n",
      "husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\n",
      "to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\n",
      "Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\n",
      "seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\n",
      "didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n",
      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\n",
      "starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\n",
      "mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\n",
      "hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n",
      "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n",
      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\n",
      "Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n",
      "\"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car\n",
      "and backed out of number four's drive.\n",
      "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\n",
      "-\n",
      "-\n",
      "something peculiar a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't\n",
      "realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again. There\n",
      "was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in\n",
      "sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\n",
      "light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\n",
      "drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\n",
      "now reading the sign that said Privet Drive no, looking at the sign; cats\n",
      "couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\n",
      "cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\n",
      "large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",
      "-\n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\n",
      "else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that\n",
      "there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you\n",
      "saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\n",
      "drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\n",
      "weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that\n",
      "man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\n",
      "nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\n",
      "stunt ―these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would\n",
      "be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\n",
      "Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\n",
      "ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\n",
      "that morning. He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\n",
      "people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\n",
      "owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\n",
      "different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\n",
      "more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch\n",
      "his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",
      "He'd for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\n",
      "them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know\n",
      "why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\n",
      "he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\n",
      "clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\n",
      "were saying.\n",
      "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard\n",
      "دو\n",
      "66\n",
      "yes, their son, Harry ·\n",
      "دو\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\n",
      "whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n",
      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\n",
      "secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\n",
      "dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\n",
      "down and stroked his mustache, thinking...no, he was being stupid. Potter\n",
      "wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\n",
      "who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew\n",
      "was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\n",
      "Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at\n",
      "any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her if he'd had a sister like that...\n",
      "but all the same, those people in cloaks…...\n",
      "-\n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\n",
      "he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\n",
      "into someone just outside the door.\n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\n",
      "a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\n",
      "cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\n",
      "contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\n",
      "passersby stare, “Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\n",
      "Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\n",
      "should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"\n",
      "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\n",
      "stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\n",
      "was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\n",
      "things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of\n",
      "imagination.\n",
      "-\n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\n",
      "and it didn't improve his mood was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It\n",
      "was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\n",
      "same markings around its eyes.\n",
      "\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n",
      "The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\n",
      "behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\n",
      "into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\n",
      "about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\n",
      "learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\n",
      "had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\n",
      "on the evening news:\n",
      "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's\n",
      "owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\n",
      "night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\n",
      "of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\n",
      "explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The\n",
      "newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\n",
      "McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\n",
      "Jim?\"\n",
      "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, “I don't know about that, but it's not\n",
      "only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,\n",
      "Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\n",
      "promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\n",
      "have been celebrating Bonfire Night early - it's not until next week, folks! But\n",
      "I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\n",
      "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\n",
      "Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a\n",
      "whisper, a whisper about the Potters....\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\n",
      "no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er\n",
      "-Petunia, dear - you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\"\n",
      "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\n",
      "they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\n",
      "\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls...shooting\n",
      "stars...and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today....”\n",
      "\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n",
      "\"Well, I just thought...maybe...it was something to do with...you\n",
      "know...her crowd.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\n",
      "whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name “Potter.\" He decided he didn't\n",
      "dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son he'd be about\n",
      "Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\"\n",
      "\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n",
      "\"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\n",
      "—\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite\n",
      "agree.\"\n",
      "He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\n",
      "While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\n",
      "window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was\n",
      "staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n",
      "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\n",
      "Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn't\n",
      "think he could bear it.\n",
      "-\n",
      "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\n",
      "Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought\n",
      "before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no\n",
      "reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well\n",
      "what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn't see how he\n",
      "and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on - he\n",
      "yawned and turned over it couldn't affect them………\n",
      "-\n",
      "How very wrong he was.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on\n",
      "the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\n",
      "statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so\n",
      "much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\n",
      "swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\n",
      "suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.\n",
      "The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\n",
      "thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\n",
      "long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\n",
      "swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\n",
      "bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\n",
      "and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\n",
      "street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\n",
      "busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize\n",
      "he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\n",
      "staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\n",
      "cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.\"\n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\n",
      "silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The\n",
      "-\n",
      "nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again the next\n",
      "lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\n",
      "only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\n",
      "were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\n",
      "now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that\n",
      "was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\n",
      "inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\n",
      "down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he\n",
      "spoke to it.\n",
      "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at\n",
      "a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\n",
      "shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\n",
      "cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\n",
      "distinctly ruffled.\n",
      "\"How did you know it was me?” she asked.\n",
      "\"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n",
      "\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\n",
      "dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I've celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You'd think\n",
      "they'd be a bit more careful, but no even the Muggles have noticed\n",
      "something's going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the\n",
      "Dursleys' dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…..shooting\n",
      "stars...Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice\n",
      "something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He\n",
      "never had much sense.\"\n",
      "\"You can't blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious\n",
      "little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\n",
      "\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that's no reason\n",
      "to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in\n",
      "broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\n",
      "دو\n",
      "She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though\n",
      "hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. “A fine\n",
      "thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared\n",
      "at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\n",
      "Dumbledore?\"\n",
      "\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful\n",
      "for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\n",
      "\"A what?\"\n",
      "\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.\"\n",
      "\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't\n",
      "think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-know-Who\n",
      "has gone\n",
      "وو\n",
      "\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by\n",
      "his name? All this 'You-Know-Who' nonsense for eleven years I have been\n",
      "trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor\n",
      "McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,\n",
      "seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-\n",
      "Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's\n",
      "name.\"\n",
      "\"I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\n",
      "exasperated, half admiring. “But you're different. Everyone knows you're the\n",
      "only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”\n",
      "\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will\n",
      "never have.\"\n",
      "\"Only because you're too — well — noble to use them.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\n",
      "told me she liked my new earmuffs.”\n",
      "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said “The\n",
      "owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what\n",
      "they're saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"\n",
      "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\n",
      "anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all\n",
      "day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a\n",
      "piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone\" was saying,\n",
      "she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.\n",
      "Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n",
      "\"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort\n",
      "turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily\n",
      "and James Potter are are\n",
      "- dead.\"\n",
      "that they're\n",
      "-\n",
      "-\n",

      "Albus...\"\n",
      "\"Lily and James...I can't believe it...I didn't want to believe it...Oh,\n",
      "Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know...I\n",
      "know...\" he said heavily.\n",
      "Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. “That's not all.\n",
      "They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But he couldn't. He\n",
      "couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that\n",
      "when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke\n",
      "that's why he's gone.\"\n",
      "Dumbledore nodded glumly.\n",
      "and\n",
      "\"It's — it's true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he's done...\n",
      "all the people he's killed...he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding...of\n",
      "all the things to stop him…..but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\"\n",
      "\"We can only guess.\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\n",
      "eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden\n",
      "watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve\n",
      "hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It\n",
      "must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his\n",
      "pocket and said, “Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by\n",
      "the way?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. “And I don't suppose you're going to\n",
      "tell me why you're here, of all places?”\n",
      "\"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family\n",
      "he has left now.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"You don't mean - you can't mean the people who live here?\" cried\n",
      "Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.\n",

      "light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange\n",
      "and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of\n",

      "of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after\n",
      "pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because\n",
      "the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\n",

      "Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\n",
      "had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\n",
      "skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of\n",
      "Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin\n",

      "held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had\n",
      "punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance\n",
      "was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\n",

      "simply grew that way all over the place.\n",
      "Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\n",

      "much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on\n",
      "his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\n",
      "Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\n",
      "Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as\n",
      "there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His\n",

      "who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon\n",
      "as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\n",

      "left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry\n",
      "hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him\n",
      "look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.\n",
      "\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though\n",
      "he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken\n",
      "her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year\n",

      "THE BOY WHO LIVED\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\n",
      "that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people\n",
      "you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\n",
      "didn't hold with such nonsense.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\n",
      "drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\n",
      "very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\n",
      "usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\n",
      "time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\n",
      "small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n",
      "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\n",
      "their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they\n",
      "could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing\n",
      "husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\n",
      "to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\n",
      "Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\n",
      "seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\n",
      "didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n",
      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\n",
      "starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\n",
      "mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\n",
      "hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n",
      "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n",
      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\n",
      "Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n",
      "\"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car\n",
      "and backed out of number four's drive.\n",
      "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\n",
      "-\n",
      "-\n",
      "something peculiar a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't\n",
      "realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again. There\n",
      "was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in\n",
      "sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\n",
      "light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\n",
      "drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\n",
      "now reading the sign that said Privet Drive no, looking at the sign; cats\n",
      "couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\n",
      "cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\n",
      "large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",
      "-\n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\n",
      "else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that\n",
      "there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you\n",
      "saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\n",
      "drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\n",
      "weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that\n",
      "man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\n",
      "nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\n",
      "stunt ―these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would\n",
      "be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\n",
      "Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\n",
      "ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\n",
      "that morning. He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\n",
      "people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\n",
      "owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\n",
      "different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\n",
      "more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch\n",
      "his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",
      "He'd for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\n",
      "them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know\n",
      "why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\n",
      "he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\n",
      "clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\n",
      "were saying.\n",
      "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard\n",
      "دو\n",
      "66\n",
      "yes, their son, Harry ·\n",
      "دو\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\n",
      "whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n",
      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\n",
      "secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\n",
      "dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\n",
      "down and stroked his mustache, thinking...no, he was being stupid. Potter\n",
      "wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\n",
      "who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew\n",
      "was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\n",
      "Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at\n",
      "any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her if he'd had a sister like that...\n",
      "but all the same, those people in cloaks…...\n",
      "-\n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\n",
      "he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\n",
      "into someone just outside the door.\n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\n",
      "a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\n",
      "cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\n",
      "contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\n",
      "passersby stare, “Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\n",
      "Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\n",
      "should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"\n",
      "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\n",
      "stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\n",
      "was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\n",
      "things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of\n",
      "imagination.\n",
      "-\n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\n",
      "and it didn't improve his mood was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It\n",
      "was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\n",
      "same markings around its eyes.\n",
      "\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n",
      "The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\n",
      "behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\n",
      "into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\n",
      "about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\n",
      "learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\n",
      "had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\n",
      "on the evening news:\n",
      "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's\n",
      "owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\n",
      "night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\n",
      "of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\n",
      "explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The\n",
      "newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\n",
      "McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\n",
      "Jim?\"\n",
      "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, “I don't know about that, but it's not\n",
      "only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,\n",
      "Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\n",
      "promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\n",
      "have been celebrating Bonfire Night early - it's not until next week, folks! But\n",
      "I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\n",
      "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\n",
      "Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a\n",
      "whisper, a whisper about the Potters....\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\n",
      "no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er\n",
      "-Petunia, dear - you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\"\n",
      "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\n",
      "they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\n",
      "\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls...shooting\n",
      "stars...and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today....”\n",
      "\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n",
      "\"Well, I just thought...maybe...it was something to do with...you\n",
      "know...her crowd.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\n",
      "whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name “Potter.\" He decided he didn't\n",
      "dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son he'd be about\n",
      "Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\"\n",
      "\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n",
      "\"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\n",
      "—\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite\n",
      "agree.\"\n",
      "He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\n",
      "While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\n",
      "window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was\n",
      "staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n",
      "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\n",
      "Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn't\n",
      "think he could bear it.\n",
      "-\n",
      "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\n",
      "Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought\n",
      "before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no\n",
      "reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well\n",
      "what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn't see how he\n",
      "and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on - he\n",
      "yawned and turned over it couldn't affect them………\n",
      "-\n",
      "How very wrong he was.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on\n",
      "the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\n",
      "statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so\n",
      "much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\n",
      "swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\n",
      "suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.\n",
      "The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\n",
      "thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\n",
      "long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\n",
      "swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\n",
      "bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\n",
      "and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\n",
      "street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\n",
      "busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize\n",
      "he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\n",
      "staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\n",
      "cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.\"\n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\n",
      "silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The\n",
      "-\n",
      "nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again the next\n",
      "lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\n",
      "only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\n",
      "were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\n",
      "now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that\n",
      "was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\n",
      "inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\n",
      "down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he\n",
      "spoke to it.\n",

      "near the dog again.\n",
      "Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such\n",
      "a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted\n",
      "now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a\n",
      "thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\n",
      "As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention\n",
      "was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.\n",
      "Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,\n",
      "and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him,\n",
      "knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when\n",
      "another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\n",
      "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n",
      "DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n",
      "It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want\n",
      "everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver\n",

      "Professor McGonagall\n",
      "Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\n",
      "\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. “I've never even\n",
      "touched one.\"\n",
      "They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\n",
      "before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way\n",
      "upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and\n",
      "felt it.\n",
      "“That's a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\n",
      "of jealousy and spite on his face. “You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years\n",
      "aren't allowed them.\"\n",
      "Ron couldn't resist it.\n",
      "\"It's not any old broomstick,” he said, “it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.\n",
      "What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron\n",
      "grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the\n",
      "Nimbus.\"\n",
      "\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the\n",

      "Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's\n",
      "“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.\n",
      "\"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, that's right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.\n",
      "\"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And\n",
      "what model is it?\"\n",
      "\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\n",
      "look of horror on Malfoy's face. \"And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've\n",
      "got it,\" he added.\n",
      "Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's\n",
      "obvious rage and confusion.\n",

      "وو\n",
      "\"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?\" came an\n",
      "angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,\n",

      "\"Yes, don't stop now,\" said Ron, \"it's doing us so much good.\"\n",
      "Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n",
      "Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\n",
      "kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under\n",
      "his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that\n",
      "night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating,\n",
      "and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n",
      "\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.\n",
      "Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\n",
      "looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of\n",
      "neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\n",
      "As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk\n",
      "toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds\n",
      "of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high\n",
      "enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden\n",
      "poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks\n",
      "Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n",
      "Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\n",
      "and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling - he swooped in and out of the\n",
      "goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand\n",
      "turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n",
      "\"Hey, Potter, come down!\"\n",
      "Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his\n",
      "arm. Harry landed next to him.\n",
      "\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall\n",
      "meant...you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this\n",
      "evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\n",
      "He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\n",
      "\"Right,\" said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\n",
      "if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them\n",
      "are called Chasers.\"\n",
      "\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\n",
      "about the size of a soccer ball.\n",
      "\"This ball's called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. “The Chasers throw the\n",
      "Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.\n",
      "Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\"\n",
      "\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\"\n",
      "Harry recited. “So that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six\n",
      "-\n",
      "دو\n",
      "hoops, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\"What's basketball?\" said Wood curiously.\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly.\n",
      "\"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper — I'm\n",
      "Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team\n",
      "from scoring.\"\n",
      "\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to\n",
      "remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\n",
      "they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n",
      "\"I'll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"\n",
      "He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n",
      "\"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. “These two\n",
      "are the Bludgers.\"\n",
      "He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\n",
      "the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the\n",
      "straps holding them inside the box.\n",
      "Bludgers.\n",
      "\"Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\n",
      "At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\n",
      "Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and\n",
      "sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then\n",
      "shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\n",
      "\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\n",
      "and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock\n",
      "players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each team the\n",
      "Weasley twins are ours it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers\n",
      "and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you've got all that?\"\n",
      "\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\n",
      "goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\"Very good,\" said Wood.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Er have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he\n",
      "sounded offhand.\n",
      "\"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing\n",
      "worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That's you. And\n",
      "you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers -\"\n",
      "66\n",
      "“— unless they crack my head open.”\n",
      "\"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I\n",
      "mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\n",
      "Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\n",
      "Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a\n",
      "large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\n",
      "\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball\n",
      "of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the\n",
      "Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters,\n",
      "Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because\n",
      "whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty\n",
      "points, so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A\n",
      "game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\n",
      "I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so\n",
      "the players could get some sleep.\n",
      "\"Well, that's it any questions?\"\n",
      "Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\n",
      "doing it that was going to be the problem.\n",
      "\"We won't practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it\n",
      "back inside the crate, “it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few\n",
      "of these.\"\n",
      "He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\n",
      "minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as\n",
      "hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n",
      "Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\n",
      "hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.\n",
      "\"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood\n",
      "happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn't be surprised if you turn\n",
      "out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he\n",
      "hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\"\n",
      "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\n",
      "three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\n",
      "believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The\n",
      "castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were\n",
      "becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\n",
      "On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking\n",
      "pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick\n",
      "announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,\n",
      "something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's\n",
      "toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to\n",
      "practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because\n",
      "Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with\n",
      "Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier\n",
      "about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick\n",
      "had arrived.\n",
      "\"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\"\n",
      "squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.\n",
      "\"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words\n",
      "properly is very important, too never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's'\n",
      "instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\"\n",
      "It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\n",
      "feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.\n",
      "Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it\n",
      "Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n",
      "Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.\n",
      "windmill.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a\n",
      "\"You're saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. “It's Wing-gar-\n",
      "dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar' nice and long.”\n",
      "\"You do it, then, if you're so clever,\" Ron snarled.\n",
      "Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,\n",
      "\"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\n",
      "heads.\n",
      "Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their\n",
      "\"Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here,\n",
      "Miss Granger's done it!\"\n",
      "Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\n",
      "\"It's no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed\n",
      "their way into the crowded corridor, \"she's a nightmare, honestly.\"\n",
      "Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.\n",
      "Harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "\"I think she heard you.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must've noticed\n",
      "she's got no friends.\"\n",
      "Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon.\n",
      "On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron\n",
      "overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in\n",
      "the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward\n",
      "at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween\n",
      "decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\n",
      "A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand\n",
      "more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the\n",
      "pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at\n",
      "the start-of-term banquet.\n",
      "Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\n",
      "came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone\n",
      "stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table,\n",
      "and gasped, \"Troll - in the dungeons-thought you ought to know.\"\n",
      "He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\n",
      "There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\n",
      "the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.\n",
      "\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories\n",
      "immediately!\"\n",
      "Percy was in his element.\n",
      "\"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you\n",
      "follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming\n",
      "through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!”\n",
      "\"How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\n",
      "\"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe\n",
      "Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"\n",
      "They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.\n",
      "As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry\n",
      "suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.\n",
      "\"I've just thought-Hermione.\"\n",
      "\"What about her?\"\n",
      "\"She doesn't know about the troll.”\n",
      "Ron bit his lip.\n",
      "“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy'd better not see us.”\n",
      "Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\n",
      "down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They\n",
      "had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\n",
      "\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n",
      "Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\n",
      "corridor and disappeared from view.\n",
      "\"What's he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn't he down in the\n",
      "dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"\n",
      "\"Search me.\"\n",
      "Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's\n",
      "fading footsteps.\n",
      "\"He's heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\n",
      "\"Can you smell something?\"\n",
      "Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\n",
      "socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n",
      "-\n",
      "And then they heard it a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\n",
      "gigantic feet. Ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left, something huge\n",
      "was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it\n",
      "emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n",
      "It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray,\n",
      "its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a\n",
      "coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell\n",
      "coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which\n",
      "dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\n",
      "The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long\n",
      "ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\n",
      "\"The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.\"\n",
      "\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.\n",
      "They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't\n",
      "about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key,\n",
      "slam the door, and lock it.\n",
      "\"Yes!\"\n",
      "a\n",
      "Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as\n",
      "they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop\n",
      "high, petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they'd just\n",
      "chained up.\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n",
      "\"It's the girls' bathroom!\" Harry gasped.\n",
      "\"Hermione!\" they said together.\n",
      "It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\n",
      "Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in\n",
      "their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\n",
      "Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if\n",
      "she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the\n",
      "walls as it went.\n",
      "\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw\n",
      "it as hard as he could against the wall.\n",
      "The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking\n",
      "stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It\n",
      "hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\n",
      "\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he\n",
      "threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its\n",
      "shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward\n",
      "Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\n",
      "\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward\n",
      "the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth\n",
      "open with terror.\n",
      "The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It\n",
      "roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\n",
      "Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He\n",
      "took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck\n",
      "from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will\n",
      "notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been\n",
      "in his hand when he'd jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.\n",
      "Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\n",
      "clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch\n",
      "him a terrible blow with the club.\n",
      "-\n",
      "Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\n",
      "not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that\n",
      "came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!”\n",
      "The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the\n",
      "air, turned slowly over and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's\n",
      "head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that\n",
      "made the whole room tremble.\n",
      "Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was\n",
      "standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\n",
      "It was Hermione who spoke first.\n",
      "\"Is it dead?\"\n",

      "them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each\n",
      "other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.\n",

      "\"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape - look.\"\n",

      "\"Leave it to me.\"\n",
      "Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron\n",
      "turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was\n",
      "almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its\n",
      "feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely\n",
      "onto one of their brooms, but it was no good – every time they got near him, the\n",
      "broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him,\n",
      "obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and\n",
      "scored five times without anyone noticing.\n",
      "\"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately.\n",
      "Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and\n",
      "was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as\n",
      "she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape,\n",
      "she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen\n",
      "words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes.\n",
      "It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A\n",

      "jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row Snape would never know\n",
      "what had happened.\n",
      "It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on\n",
      "to his broom.\n",
      "\"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into\n",
      "Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.\n",

      "fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand.\n",

      "\"I've got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game\n",
      "ended in complete confusion.\n",
      "\"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling\n",
      "twenty minutes later, but it made no difference Harry hadn't broken any rules\n",
      "and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results - Gryffindor had won by\n",
      "one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He\n",
      "was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and\n",
      "Hermione.\n",
      "\"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him. He was\n",
      "cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.”\n",
      "\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on\n",
      "next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin' like that?\"\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell\n",
      "him. Harry decided on the truth.\n",
      "\"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past\n",
      "that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal\n",
      "whatever it's guarding.\"\n",
      "Hagrid dropped the teapot.\n",

      "“I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don' know why\n",
      "Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now,\n",
      "listen to me, all three of yeh yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's\n",

      "No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor\n",

      "He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.\n",
      "Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy\n",
      "had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted\n",
      "that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-\n",

      "that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way\n",
      "Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and\n",
      "angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\n",

      "Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of\n",
      "students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at\n",

      "Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr.\n",
      "and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\n",
      "When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir\n",

      "and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\n",
      "\"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the\n",

      "\"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy's cold drawl\n",

      "to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose that hut of\n",
      "Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to.\"\n",

      "Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes.\n",

      "\"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked.\n",

      "anywhere just give us a hint I know I've read his name somewhere.\"\n",
      "\"I'm sayin' nothin', said Hagrid flatly.\n",
      "\"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid\n",
      "looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\n",
      "They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since\n",
      "Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape\n",
      "was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin,\n",
      "not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't\n",
      "in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our\n",
      "Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A\n",
      "Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the\n",
      "sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves;\n",
      "hundreds of narrow rows.\n",
      "Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search\n",
      "while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the\n",
      "shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been\n",
      "wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you\n",
      "needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the\n",
      "restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books\n",
      "containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by\n",
      "older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n",
      "\"What are you looking for, boy?\"\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Harry.\n",
      "Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\n",
      "\"You'd better get out, then. Go on\n",
      "out!\"\n",
      "Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the\n",
      "library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam\n",
      "Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them,\n",
      "but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\n",
      "Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\n",
      "anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks,\n",
      "after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising\n",
      "they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without\n",
      "Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\n",
      "Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.\n",
      "They went off to lunch.\n",
      "\"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\" said Hermione.\n",
      "\"And send me an owl if you find anything.\"\n",
      "\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"It'd be safe to ask them.”\n",
      "\"Very safe, as they're both dentists,\" said Hermione.\n",
      "Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to\n",
      "think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\n",
      "common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good\n",
      "armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a\n",
      "toasting fork-bread, English muffins, marshmallows and plotting ways of\n",
      "getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't\n",
      "work.\n",
      "-\n",
      "Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\n",
      "Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like\n",
      "directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything\n",
      "else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this\n",
      "case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron\n",
      "knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\n",
      "-\n",
      "Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they\n",
      "didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting\n",
      "different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don't send me there, can't\n",
      "you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\"\n",
      "On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for\n",
      "the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early\n",
      "in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at\n",
      "the foot of his bed.\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\n",
      "pulled on his bathrobe.\n",
      "\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!\"\n",
      "\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\n",
      "was a lot bigger than Harry's.\n",
      "Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\n",
      "scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden\n",
      "flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it it sounded a bit\n",
      "like an owl.\n",
      "A second, very small parcel contained a note.\n",
      "-\n",
      "We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From\n",
      "Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\n",
      "\"That's friendly,\" said Harry.\n",
      "Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n",
      "\"Weird!\" he said, 'What a shape! This is money?\"\n",
      "\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid\n",
      "and my aunt and uncle so who sent these?\"\n",
      "\"I think I know who that one's from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and\n",
      "pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn't expect any\n",
      "presents and oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she's made you a Weasley sweater.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\n",
      "emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\n",
      "\"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own,\n",
      "\"and mine's always maroon.\"\n",
      "tasty.\n",
      "\"That's really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very\n",
      "His next present also contained candy -\n",
      "from Hermione.\n",
      "-\n",
      "a large box of Chocolate Frogs\n",
      "This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light.\n",
      "He unwrapped it.\n",
      "Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay\n",
      "in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n",
      "\"I've heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\n",
      "Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. “If that's what I think it is\n",
      "they're really rare, and really valuable.\"\n",
      "\"What is it?”\n",
      "-\n",
      "Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the\n",
      "touch, like water woven into material.\n",
      "it is\n",
      "-\n",
      "“It's an invisibility cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I'm sure\n",
      "try it on.\"\n",
      "Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n",
      "\"It is! Look down!\"\n",
      "Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\n",
      "mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended\n",
      "in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and\n",
      "his reflection vanished completely.\n",
      "\"There's a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!”\n",
      "Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy\n",
      "writing he had never seen before were the following words:\n",
      "Your father left this in my possession before he died.\n",
      "It is time it was returned to you.\n",
      "Use it well.\n",
      "A Very Merry Christmas to you.\n",
      "There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\n",
      "cloak.\n",
      "matter?\"\n",
      "\"I'd give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What's the\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\n",
      "it really once belonged to his father?\n",
      "Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\n",
      "open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly\n",
      "out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas!”\n",
      "\"Hey, look-Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\"\n",
      "Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F\n",
      "on it, the other a G.\n",
      "\"Harry's is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry's\n",
      "sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\"\n",
      "\"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. “Come on,\n",
      "get it on, they're lovely and warm.\"\n",
      "\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n",
      "\"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed. “I suppose she\n",
      "thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid we know we're\n",
      "called Gred and Forge.\"\n",
      "\"What's all this noise?\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\n",
      "had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a\n",
      "lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\n",
      "“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even\n",

      "it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long\n",

      "a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone\n",
      "was there who shouldn't be.\n",
      "He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\n",
      "he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black\n",
      "and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was\n",
      "very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\n",
      "-\n",
      "A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was\n",
      "screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high,\n",
      "unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp,\n",
      "which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor\n",

      "noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall,\n",
      "breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close,\n",
      "very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he\n",
      "had hidden in.\n",

      "It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\n",
      "frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the\n",
      "top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there\n",
      "was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to\n",
      "look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\n",
      "He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\n",
      "whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book\n",
      "had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole\n",
      "crowd of people standing right behind him.\n",
      "But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\n",

      "-\n",
      "There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\n",

      "invisible or not?\n",
      "-\n",
      "He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\n",

      "behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so\n",
      "close together, but he felt only air - she and the others existed only in the mirror.\n",
      "She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes her\n",
      "eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright\n",
      "green exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying;\n",
      "smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing\n",
      "next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very\n",
      "untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.\n",

      "noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's\n",
      "knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n",

      "them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall\n",
      "right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half\n",
      "joy, half terrible sadness.\n",
      "How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade\n",
      "and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.\n",

      "had started again.\n",
      "Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that\n",
      "had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained\n",

      "\"Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. \"That's exactly the sort of\n",
      "thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking\n",
      "for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\"\n",
      "George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\n",
      "\"Snape's refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When's\n",

      "overtake Slytherin.\"\n",
      "The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\n",
      "\"It's not my fault,” said Wood. \"We've just got to make sure we play a\n",
      "clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us.\"\n",
      "Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for\n",
      "not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....\n",
      "The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end\n",

      "of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and\n",
      "slammed them down on the table.\n",
      "\"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!\n",
      "Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to\n",
      "Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.\"\n",
      "\"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met\n",
      "him,“ said Harry.\n",
      "\"But it's against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by\n",
      "the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop\n",
      "Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden\n",
      "anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns\n",
      "Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania.”\n",
      "\"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and Hebridean\n",
      "Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our\n",
      "kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them\n",
      "forget.”\n",
      "\"So what on earth's Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione.\n",
      "When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they\n",
      "were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?”\n",
      "before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\n",
      "It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was\n",
      "a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat\n",
      "sandwiches, which they refused.\n",
      "\"So― yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. “We were\n",
      "wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from\n",
      "Fluffy.\"\n",
      "Hagrid frowned at him.\n",
      "\"O' course I can't,\" he said. “Number one, I don' know meself. Number\n",
      "two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's\n",
      "here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts I s'ppose yeh've\n",
      "worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy.\"\n",
      "—\n",
      "\"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,\n",
      "you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm,\n",
      "flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We\n",
      "only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione went on. “We\n",
      "wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\"\n",
      "Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\n",
      "Hermione.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that...let's see...he\n",
      "borrowed Fluffy from me...then some o' the teachers did enchantments…..\n",
      "Professor Sprout - Professor Flitwick Professor McGonagall -\" he ticked\n",
      "them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell an' Dumbledore himself did\n",

      "Snape.\"\n",
      "\"Snape?\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Yeah-yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect\n",
      "the Stone, he's not about ter steal it.\"\n",
      "Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If\n",
      "Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\n",
      "how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything except,\n",
      "it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you,\n",
      "Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? Not\n",
      "even one of the teachers?\"\n",
      "\"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly.\n",
      "\"Well, that's something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we\n",
      "have a window open? I'm boiling.\"\n",
      "\"Can't, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire.\n",
      "Harry looked at it, too.\n",
      "\"Hagrid what's that?\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath\n",
      "the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n",
      "دو\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That's er...'\n",
      "“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a\n",
      "closer look at the egg. “It must've cost you a fortune.\"\n",
      "\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. “Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few\n",
      "drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter\n",
      "get rid of it, ter be honest.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?” said Hermione.\n",
      "\"Well, I've bin doin' some readin',” said Hagrid, pulling a large book\n",
      "from under his pillow. “Got this outta the library Dragon Breeding for\n",
      "Pleasure and Profit- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here. Keep the\n",

      "So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to\n",
      "Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n",
      "\"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening\n",
      "after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.\n",
      "Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It\n",
      "was driving them nuts.\n",
      "Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from\n",
      "Hagrid. He had written only two words: It's hatching.\n",
      "Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\n",
      "wouldn't hear of it.\n",
      "\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\n",

      "\"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what\n",
      "Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing—”\n",
      "\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\n",
      "much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.\n",
      "Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\n",
      "Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning\n",
      "break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three\n",
      "of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the\n",
      "edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\n",
      "\"It's nearly out.\" He ushered them inside.\n",
      "The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\n",
      "was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n",
      "They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\n",
      "All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\n",
      "dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked\n",
      "like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its\n",
      "skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and\n",
      "bulging, orange eyes.\n",
      "It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n",
      "“Isn't he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\n",

      "Pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had\n",

      "because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall,\n",

      "Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the\n",

      "Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione\n",
      "the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They\n",

      "All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had\n",

      "what they'd got.\n",
      "At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\n",

      "horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.\n",
      "The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\n",
      "into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut. Then\n",

      "\"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\"\n",
      "Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\n",

      "Neville, and Fang took the right.\n",
      "They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a\n",
      "ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on\n",

      "Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n",
      "\"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.\n",

      "ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead\n",
      "leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was\n",
      "squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\n",
      "“I knew it,\" he murmured. “There's summat in here that shouldn' be.”\n",

      "-\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I'm glad we've run inter\n",

      "\"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said\n",
      "Hagrid. “So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?”\n",
      "Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The forest\n",

      "A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\n",
      "but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking\n",

      "\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\"\n",
      "\"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in\n",
      "here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured - would yeh know anythin' about it?\"\n",
      "Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. “Mars is\n",
      "bright tonight,\" he said simply.\n",
      "\"We've heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see\n",
      "anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then.\"\n",
      "Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\n",
      "shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\n",
      "“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an' get a straight answer out of a\n",
      "centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon.\"\n",
      "\"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione.\n",
      "\"Oh, a fair few....Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're\n",
      "good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind,\n",
      "centaurs...they know things...jus' don' let on much.\"\n",
      "\"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.\n",
      "\"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's\n",
      "bin killin' the unicorns – never heard anythin' like it before.”\n",
      "They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\n",
      "nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched.\n",
      "He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just\n",
      "passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm.\n",
      "\"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\"\n",
      "\"You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I'll come back\n",
      "for yeh!\"\n",
      "They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood\n",
      "looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the\n",
      "rustling of leaves around them.\n",
      "\"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.\n",
      "\"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville...it's our fault\n",
      "he's here in the first place.\"\n",
      "The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's\n",
      "seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was\n",
      "going on? Where were the others?\n",
      "At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy,\n",
      "Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had\n",
      "sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and\n",
      "sent up the sparks.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were\n",
      "makin'. Right, we're changin' groups Neville, you stay with me an'\n",
      "Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry,\" Hagrid added in a\n",
      "whisper to Harry, “but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an’ we've gotta\n",
      "get this done.\"\n",
      "So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\n",
      "walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\n",
      "became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry\n",
      "thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots\n",
      "of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.\n",
      "Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\n",
      "oak.\n",
      "\"Look\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n",
      "Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n",
      "It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\n",

      "reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and\n",
      "began to drink its blood.\n",
      "\"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"\n",
      "so did Fang. The hooded\n",

      "Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted\n",

      "Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though\n",

      "behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the\n",
      "figure.\n",
      "The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute\n",
      "or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing\n",
      "over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair\n",
      "and a palomino body.\n",
      "\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n",
      "\"Yes - thank you — what was that?”\n",
      "The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\n",
      "sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood\n",
      "out, livid, on Harry's forehead.\n",
      "\"You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid.\n",
      "The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be\n",
      "quicker this way.\n",
      "\"My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\n",
      "legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n",
      "There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\n",
      "clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving\n",
      "and sweaty.\n",
      "\"Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on\n",
      "your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\n",
      "\"Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The\n",
      "quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"\n",
      "\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze,\n",
      "we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is\n",
      "to come in the movements of the planets?\"\n",
      "Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was\n",
      "acting for the best,\" he said in his gloomy voice.\n",
      "Bane kicked his back legs in anger.\n",
      "\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\n",
      "what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after\n",
      "stray humans in our forest!\"\n",
      "Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to\n",
      "grab his shoulders to stay on.\n",
      "\"Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not\n",
      "understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I\n",
      "set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans\n",
      "alongside me if I must.”\n",
      "And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\n",
      "they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n",
      "Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.\n",
      "\"Why's Bane so angry?\" he asked. “What was that thing you saved me\n",
      "from, anyway?\"\n",
      "Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case\n",
      "of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their\n",
      "way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't\n",
      "want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense\n",
      "patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n",
      "\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We've only used the horn\n",
      "and tail hair in Potions.\"\n",
      "\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze.\n",
      "\"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\n",
      "crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from\n",
      "death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to\n",
      "save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment\n",
      "the blood touches your lips.\"\n",
      "Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in\n",
      "the moonlight.\n",
      "\"But who'd be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you're going to\n",
      "be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough\n",
      "to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength\n",
      "something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you\n",
      "and power\n",

      "-\n",
      "\"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course the Elixir of Life! But I don't\n",

      "\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,\n",
      "who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"\n",
      "It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart.\n",
      "Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\n",
      "him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion.\n",
      "Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\"\n",
      "\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\"\n",
      "\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\"\n",
      "Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\n",
      "behind her.\n",
      "“I'm fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The\n",
      "unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.\"\n",
      "\"This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\n",
      "examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.\"\n",
      "Harry slid off his back.\n",
      "\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. “The planets have been read\n",
      "wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\"\n",
      "He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry\n",
      "shivering behind him.\n",
      "Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.\n",
      "He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him\n",
      "awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell\n",
      "him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\n",
      "Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He\n",
      "was still shaking.\n",
      "\"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort...and Voldemort's waiting in the\n",
      "forest...and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich....\"\n",
      "\"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought\n",
      "Voldemort could hear them.\n",
      "Harry wasn't listening.\n",

      "They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\n",

      "goes\n",
      "\"Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”\n",

      "He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but\n",
      "from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.\n",
      "Slowly, the dog's growls ceased-it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees,\n",
      "then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n",
      "\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\n",
      "crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they\n",
      "approached the giant heads. \"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\" said\n",
      "Ron, peering over the dog's back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\"\n",
      "\"No, I don't!\"\n",
      "\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's\n",
      "legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\n",
      "\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously.\n",
      "\"Nothing just black there's no way of climbing down, we'll just\n",

      "and pointed at himself.\n",
      "\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. “I don't know how deep\n",
      "this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\"\n",
      "Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled\n",
      "and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep\n",
      "sleep.\n",
      "Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was\n",
      "no sign of the bottom.\n",
      "He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\n",
      "fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don't\n",
      "follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\"\n",
      "\"Right,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"See you in a minute, I hope ...'\n",

      "down and\n",
      "-\n",
      "FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something\n",
      "soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though\n",
      "he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n",
      "\"It's okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which\n",
      "was the open trapdoor, “it's a soft landing, you can jump!”\n",
      "Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n",
      "\"What's this stuff?\" were his first words.\n",
      "“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall.\n",
      "Come on, Hermione!\"\n",
      "The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\n",
      "Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.\n",
      "\"We must be miles under the school,\" she said.\n",
      "\"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\"\n",
      "She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\n",
      "because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike\n",
      "tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been\n",
      "bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n",
      "Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\n",
      "her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them,\n",
      "but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound\n",
      "around them.\n",
      "\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is — it's\n",
      "Devil's Snare!”\n",
      "\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled\n",
      "Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut\n",
      "up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.\n",
      "\"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\n",
      "curled around his chest.\n",
      "\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare...what did Professor Sprout say? - it likes\n",
      "the dark and the damp.”\n",

      "“So light a fire!\" Harry choked.\n",
      "\"Yes of course\n",

      "“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR\n",
      "“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\n",
      "muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on\n",
      "Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip\n",
      "as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it\n",
      "unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n",
      "\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he\n",

      "He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s\n",
      "horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the\n",

      "\"Do we\n",

      "Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\n",
      "\"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\n",
      "\"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"\n",
      "\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next\n",
      "to him instead of that castle.'\n",
      "\"What about you?\"\n",

      "\"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron.\n",
      "The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\n",
      "knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked\n",
      "off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\n",
      "\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board.\n",
      "\"Yes...look...\"\n",
      "A white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n",
      "Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\n",
      "sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n",
      "\"Harry move diagonally four squares to the right.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\n",
      "queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay\n",
      "quite still, facedown.\n",
      "“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to\n",
      "take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\n",
      "Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\n",
      "Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice,\n",
      "Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He\n",
      "himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had\n",
      "lost black ones.\n",

      "\"Yes...\" said Ron softly, “It's the only way...I've got to be taken.\"\n",
      "\"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted.\n",
      "\"That's chess!\" snapped Ron. “You've got to make some sacrifices! I\n",

      "\"But-\n",

      "There was no alternative.\n",

      "don't hang around once you've won.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\n",
      "across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor Hermione\n",
      "screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged Ron to one side.\n",
      "He looked as if he'd been knocked out.\n",
      "-\n",
      "Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n",
      "The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had\n",
      "won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one\n",
      "last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door\n",
      "and up the next passageway.\n",
      "\"What if he's —?”\n",
      "\"He'll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you\n",
      "reckon's next?\"\n",
      "\"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put\n",
      "charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive;\n",
      "that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's.\"\n",
      "They had reached another door.\n",
      "\"All right?\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "\"Go on.\"\n",
      "Harry pushed it open.\n",
      "A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their\n",
      "robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of\n",
      "them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody\n",
      "lump on its head.\n",
      "“I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they\n",
      "stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can't breathe.\"\n",
      "He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\n",
      "came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with\n",
      "seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n",
      "\"Snape's,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"\n",
      "They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\n",
      "them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same\n",
      "instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n",
      "\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry\n",
      "looked over her shoulder to read it:\n",
      "Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n",
      "Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n",
      "One among us seven will let you move ahead,\n",
      "Another will transport the drinker back instead,\n",
      "Two among our number hold only nettle wine,\n",
      "Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\n",
      "Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n",
      "To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\n",
      "First, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n",
      "You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;\n",
      "Second, different are those who stand at either end,\n",
      "But if\n",
      "you would move onward, neither is your friend;\n",
      "Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n",
      "Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n",
      "Fourth, the second left and the second on the right\n",
      "Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n",
      "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling,\n",
      "the very last thing he felt like doing.\n",
      "\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn't magic - it's logic - a puzzle. A\n",
      "lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here\n",
      "forever.\"\n",
      "“But so will we, won't we?”\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this\n",
      "paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely\n",
      "through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\"\n",
      "\"But how do we know which to drink?”\n",
      "\"Give me a minute.”\n",
      "Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down\n",
      "the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped\n",
      "her hands.\n",
      "“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black\n",
      "fire toward the Stone.\"\n",
      "Harry looked at the tiny bottle.\n",
      "\"There's only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That's hardly one\n",
      "swallow.\"\n",
      "They looked at each other.\n",
      "\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\"\n",
      "Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\n",
      "“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\n",
      "brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past\n",
      "Fluffy go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need\n",
      "him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him,\n",
      "really.\"\n",

      "might get lucky again.\"\n",
      "Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\n",
      "arms around him.\n",
      "\"Hermione!\"\n",
      "\"Harry you're a great wizard, you know.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\"I'm not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\n",
      "\"Me!\" said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more\n",
      "important things friendship and bravery and oh Harry be careful!\"\n",
      "Harry-be\n",
      "\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren't you?\"\n",
      "\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at\n",
      "the end, and shuddered.\n",
      "\"It's not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.\n",
      "\"No but it's like ice.\"\n",

      "face the black flames.\n",
      "\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\n",
      "It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle\n",
      "down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his\n",

      "\"But I thought - Snape ―\"\n",
      "\"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble,\n",
      "either, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So\n",
      "useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who\n",

      "knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She\n",
      "broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off\n",

      "countercurse, trying to save you.\"\n",
      "\"Snape was trying to save me?\"\n",
      "\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"Why do you think he wanted to\n",
      "referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny,\n",
      "really...he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore\n",
      "watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor\n",
      "from winning, he did make himself unpopular...and what a waste of time, when\n",
      "after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight.\"\n",
      "Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\n",
      "themselves tightly around Harry.\n",
      "\"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on\n",
      "Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was\n",
      "guarding the Stone.\"\n",
      "\"You let the troll in?\"\n",
      "\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls - you must have seen what I\n",
      "did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else\n",
      "was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went\n",
      "straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat\n",
      "you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off\n",
      "properly.\n",
      "\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\"\n",
      "It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It\n",
      "was the Mirror of Erised.\n",
      "\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping\n",
      "his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like\n",
      "this...but he's in London...I'll be far away by the time he gets back...\"\n",
      "All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\n",
      "from concentrating on the mirror.\n",
      "\"I saw you and Snape in the forest he blurted out.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.\n",
      "\"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected\n",
      "me all along. Tried to frighten me as though he could, when I had Lord\n",
      "Voldemort on my side....\"\n",
      "Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n",
      "“I see the Stone…I'm presenting it to my master...but where is it?”\n",
      "Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He\n",
      "had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n",
      "\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts\n",
      "with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never\n",
      "wanted you dead.\"\n",
      "\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing - I thought Snape was\n",
      "threatening you....\"\n",
      "For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.\n",
      "\"Sometimes,\" he said, “I find it hard to follow my master's instructions\n",
      "he is a great wizard and I am weak —”\n",
      "\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped.\n",
      "\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I\n",
      "traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous\n",
      "ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There\n",
      "is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it...Since\n",
      "then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He\n",
      "has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive\n",
      "mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most\n",
      "displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on\n",

      "Quirrell cursed under his breath.\n",
      "\"I don't understand...is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?”\n",
      "Harry's mind was racing.\n",
      "What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he\n",
      "thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I\n",
      "should see myself finding it - which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how\n",
      "can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to?\n",
      "-\n",
      "He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell\n",
      "noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.\n",
      "Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\n",
      "\"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\"\n",
      "And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come\n",
      "from Quirrell himself.\n",
      "\"Use the boy... Use the boy....”\n",
      "Quirrell rounded on Harry.\n",
      "\"Yes Potter — come here.\"\n",

      "I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see,\n",

      "the mirror, and opened them again.\n",
      "He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\n",
      "later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a\n",
      "blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did\n",
      "so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow - incredibly\n",
      "he'd gotten the Stone.\n",
      "\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\"\n",

      "looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n",
      "“Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.\n",
      "Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct,\n",
      "reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face -\n",
      "\"AAAARGH!”\n",
      "Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\n",
      "Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain - his\n",
      "only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him\n",
      "from doing a curse.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-\n",
      "-\n",
      "Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight\n",
      "as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off the pain in\n",
      "Harry's head was building he couldn't see he could only hear Quirrell's\n",
      "terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other\n",
      "voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!\"\n",
      "He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and\n",
      "fell into blackness, down...down... down....\n",
      "Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it,\n",
      "but his arms were too heavy.\n",
      "strange.\n",
      "He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\n",
      "He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into\n",
      "view above him.\n",
      "\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore.\n",
      "Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was\n",
      "Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir, quick―\"\n",
      "\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said\n",
      "Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\"\n",
      "\"Then who does? Sir, I―\"\n",
      "\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\"\n",
      "Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\n",
      "hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him\n",
      "was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n",
      "\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming.\n",
      "\"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\n",
      "complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends\n",
      "Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet\n",
      "seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt\n",
      "it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.”\n",
      "\"How long have I been in here?\"\n",
      "\"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most\n",
      "relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"\n",
      "\"But sir, the Stone—”\n",
      "\"I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\n",
      "Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that,\n",
      "although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.”\n",
      "\"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?\"\n",
      "\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than\n",
      "it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I\n",
      "arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\"\n",
      "\"It was you.\"\n",
      "\"I feared I might be too late.\"\n",
      "دو\n",
      "\"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer\n",
      "“Not the Stone, boy, you the effort involved nearly killed you. For one\n",
      "terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been\n",
      "destroyed.\"\n",
      "\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. “But your friend - Nicolas Flamel —”\n",
      "\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite\n",
      "delighted. \"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have\n",
      "had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.\"\n",
      "“But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?\"\n",
      "\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,\n",
      "they will die.\"\n",
      "Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.\n",
      "\"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and\n",
      "Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the\n",
      "well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone\n",
      "was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could\n",
      "want! The two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble\n",
      "is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled\n",
      "at the ceiling.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Sir?\" said Harry. “I've been thinking…….sir even if the Stone's gone,\n",
      "Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”\n",
      "\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\n",
      "of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't\n",
      "he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?\"\n",
      "\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\n",
      "for another body to share...not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left\n",
      "Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it\n",
      "will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing\n",
      "battle next time and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never\n",
      "return to power.\"\n",
      "Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\n",
      "he said, “Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can tell me……\n",
      "things I want to know the truth about....\"\n",
      "\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and\n",
      "should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your\n",
      "questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll\n",
      "forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”\n",
      "\"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\n",
      "to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first\n",
      "place?\"\n",
      "Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\n",
      "“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now.\n",
      "You will know, one day...put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are\n",
      "older...I know you hate to hear this...when you are ready, you will know.\"\n",
      "And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\n",
      "\"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?\"\n",
      "\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\n",
      "understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's\n",
      "for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign...to have been loved so\n",
      "deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some\n",
      "protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and\n",
      "ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It\n",
      "was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"\n",
      "Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\n",
      "which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice\n",
      "again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak-do you know who sent it to\n",
      "me?\"\n",
      "\"Ah-your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought\n",
      "you might like it.\" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. “Useful things...your father\n",
      "used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"\n",
      "\"And there's something else...\"\n",
      "true?\"\n",
      "\"Fire away.\"\n",
      "\"Quirrell said Snape\n",
      "وو\n",
      "“Professor Snape, Harry.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.\n",
      "Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.”\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\"He saved his life.\"\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people's minds\n",
      "work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt…..I do\n",
      "believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would\n",
      "make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father's\n",
      "memory in peace....\"\n",
      "Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\n",
      "\"And sir, there's one more thing……”\n",
      "\"Just the one?\"\n",
      "\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”\n",
      "\"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant\n",
      "ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who\n",
      "wanted to find the Stone find it, but not use it would be able to get it,\n",
      "otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My\n",
      "-\n",
      "brain surprises even me sometimes...Now, enough questions. I suggest you\n",
      "make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was\n",
      "unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since\n",
      "then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them but I think I'll be safe with\n",
      "a nice toffee, don't you?\"\n",
      "He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he\n",
      "choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!\"\n",
      "Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\n",
      "\"Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.\n",
      "\"Absolutely not.”\n",
      "\"You let Professor Dumbledore in………”\n",
      "\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.”\n",
      "\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\n",
      "Pomfrey...”\n",
      "\"Oh, very well,\" she said. “But five minutes only.\"\n",
      "And she let Ron and Hermione in.\n",
      "\"Harry!\"\n",
      "Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry\n",
      "was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\n",
      "\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to\n",
      "worried,\n",
      "وو\n",
      "happened?\"\n",
      "Dumbledore was so\n",
      "\"The whole school's talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really\n",
      "It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\n",
      "strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell;\n",
      "the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good\n",
      "audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was\n",
      "under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n",
      "-\n",
      "'to\n",
      "\"So the Stone's gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel's just going to die?\"\n",
      "“That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that what was it?\n",
      "the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\"\"\n",
      "\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed\n",
      "at how crazy his hero was.\n",
      "\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round — that\n",
      "took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore\n",
      "when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew he just said,\n",
      "'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "“D’you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. “Sending you your\n",
      "father's cloak and everything?\"\n",
      "\"Well,\" Hermione exploded, \"if he did\n",
      "you could have been killed.”\n",
      "- I mean to say that's terrible\n",
      "\"No, it isn't,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I\n",
      "think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less\n",
      "everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we\n",
      "were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I\n",
      "don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's\n",
      "almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could....”\n",
      "\"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen,\n",
      "you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and\n",
      "Slytherin won, of course you missed the last Quidditch match, we were\n",
      "-\n",
      "steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you but the food'll be good.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\n",
      "\"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT” she said firmly.\n",
      "After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\n",
      "I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his\n",
      "many candy boxes. I can, can't I?”\n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” she said\n",
      "stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky\n",
      "feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\"\n",
      "Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\n",
      "indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took\n",
      "one look at him, and burst into tears.\n",
      "\"It's all\n",
      "-\n",
      "-\n",
      "my ruddy\n",

      "didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a dragon egg! I'll never\n",
      "drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!\"\n",
      "\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\n",

      "somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you\n",
      "hadn't told him.”\n",
      "\"Yeh could've died!” sobbed Hagrid. \"An' don' say the name!\"\n",
      "\"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he\n",
      "stopped crying. \"I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up,\n",

      "I've got loads.….…..”\n",
      "Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That reminds\n",
      "me. I've got yeh a present.”\n",
      "\"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid\n",
      "gave a weak chuckle.\n",
      "\"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'course, he\n",
      "shoulda sacked me instead anyway, got yeh this……..”\n",
      "It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it\n",
      "curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from\n",
      "every page were his mother and father.\n",
      "\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos...\n",
      "knew yeh didn' have any...d'yeh like it?\"\n",
      "Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.\n",
      "Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had\n",
      "been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one\n",
      "last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the\n",
      "Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house\n",
      "cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent\n",
      "covered the wall behind the High Table.\n",
      "When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody\n",
      "started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\n",
      "at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up\n",
      "to look at him.\n",
      "Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n",
      "\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must trouble\n",
      "you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our\n",
      "delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little\n",
      "fuller than they were...you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and\n",
      "empty before next year starts....\n",
      "\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the\n",
      "points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve\n",
      "points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has\n",
      "four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\"\n",
      "A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.\n",
      "Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent\n",
      "events must be taken into account.\"\n",
      "The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\n",
      "“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out.\n",
      "Let me see. Yes...\n",
      "\"First\n",
      "-to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"\n",
      "Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\n",
      "“…for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I\n",
      "award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\n",
      "Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead\n",
      "seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother,\n",
      "you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!\"\n",
      "At last there was silence again.\n",
      "\"Second\n",
      "-\n",
      "to Miss Hermione Granger...for the use of cool logic in the\n",
      "face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\n",
      "—\n",
      "Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had\n",
      "burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves\n",
      "they were a hundred points up.\n",
      "\"Third\n",
      "-\n",
      "to Mr. Harry Potter…..” said Dumbledore. The room went\n",
      "deadly quiet. “…..for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor\n",
      "house sixty points.”\n",
      "The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling\n",
      "themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two\n",
      "points exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup - if\n",
      "only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\n",
      "-\n",
      "Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n",
      "\"There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a\n",
      "great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to\n",
      "our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\"\n",
      "Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\n",
      "sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the\n",
      "Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as\n",
      "Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He\n",
      "had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering,\n",
      "nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more\n",
      "stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\n",
      "\"Which means,\" Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even\n",
      "Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need\n",
      "a little change of decoration.\"\n",
      "He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet\n",
      "and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering\n",
      "Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand,\n",
      "with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that\n",
      "Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It\n",
      "seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever\n",
      "was at Hogwarts.\n",
      "It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch,\n",
      "or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls...he would never, ever forget\n",
      "tonight.\n",
      "Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come\n",
      "they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks;\n",
      "Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped\n",
      "through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They\n",
      "had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be\n",
      "thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't\n",
      "have everything in life.\n",
      "And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,\n",
      "Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out\n",

      "empty. There were only two rooms.\n",

      "off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor\n",
      "he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n",

      "began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a\n",

      "bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.\n",

      "For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\n",
      "sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a\n",
      "long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was\n",
      "quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\n",
      "when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled\n",

      "of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\n",

      "the very thought.\n",
      "But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\n",

      "Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\n",
      "counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n",
      "\"Three up...two across...\" he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.\"\n",
      "He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n",

      "The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a\n",
      "small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were\n",
      "facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled\n",
      "street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n",
      "\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.\"\n",
      "He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway.\n",
      "Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\n",
      "back into solid wall.\n",
      "The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\n",

      "\"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money\n",
      "Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\n",
      "direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the\n",
      "shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman\n",
      "outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon\n",
      "liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad………”\n",

      "دو\n",
      "A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops\n",
      "Owl Emporium Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of\n",
      "about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in\n",
      "it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand\n",
      "fastest ever\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and\n",
      "strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with\n",
      "barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and\n",
      "rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....\n",
      "\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.\n",
      "They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\n",
      "little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\n",
      "scarlet and gold, was\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Yeah, that's a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\n",
      "stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had\n",
      "a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and\n",
      "feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\n",
      "doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\n",
      "Enter, stranger, but take heed\n",
      "Of what awaits the sin of greed,\n",
      "For those who take, but do not earn,\n",
      "Must pay most dearly in their turn.\n",
      "So if you seek beneath our floors\n",
      "A treasure that was never yours,\n",
      "Thief, you have been warned, beware\n",
      "Of finding more than treasure there.\n",
      "\"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\" said Hagrid.\n",
      "A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\n",
      "vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools\n",
      "behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales,\n",
      "examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to\n",
      "count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out\n",
      "of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\n",
      "“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We've come ter take some\n",
      "money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe.\"\n",
      "\"You have his key, sir?\"\n",
      "\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\n",
      "pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the\n",
      "goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the\n",
      "goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n",
      "\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n",
      "The goblin looked at it closely.\n",
      "\"That seems to be in order.\"\n",
      "\"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid\n",
      "importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It's about the You-Know-What in vault\n",
      "seven hundred and thirteen.\"\n",
      "The goblin read the letter carefully.\n",
      "\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have someone\n",
      "take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\"\n",
      "Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog.\n",
      "biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of\n",
      "the doors leading off the hall.\n",
      "\"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?”\n",
      "Harry asked.\n",
      "\"Can't tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts\n",
      "business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that.”\n",
      "Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\n",
      "marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\n",
      "torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the\n",
      "floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\n",
      "them. They climbed in - Hagrid with some difficulty and were off.\n",
      "-\n",
      "At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried\n",
      "to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.\n",
      "The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't\n",
      "steering.\n",
      "Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\n",
      "wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and\n",
      "twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late they plunged even\n",
      "deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew\n",
      "from the ceiling and floor.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what's\n",
      "the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"\n",
      "\"Stalagmite's got an ‘m' in it,” said Hagrid. “An' don' ask me questions\n",
      "just now, I think I'm gonna be sick.\"\n",
      "He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\n",
      "door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop\n",
      "his knees from trembling.\n",
      "Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out,\n",
      "and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of\n",
      "silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n",
      "\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.\n",
      "All Harry's\n",
      "-\n",
      "it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known\n",
      "about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\n",
      "they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had\n",
      "been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n",
      "Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n",
      "\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to\n",
      "a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right, that should\n",
      "be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to\n",
      "Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more\n",
      "slowly?\"\n",
      "\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.\n",
      "They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\n",
      "colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an\n",
      "underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down\n",
      "at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his\n",
      "neck.\n",
      "Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n",
      "\"Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently\n",
      "with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n",
      "\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the\n",
      "door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.\n",
      "\"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?\" Harry asked.\n",
      "\"About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n",
      "-\n",
      "Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\n",
      "Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels\n",
      "at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby\n",
      "little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\n",
      "and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew\n",
      "better than to ask.\n",
      "\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way\n",
      "back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.\n",
      "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.\n",

      "\"Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things\n",

      "He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he\n",

      "waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk\n",
      "had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into\n",
      "sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\n",
      "They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped\n",
      "Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought\n",
      "this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms\n",
      "with a nasty grin on his face.\n",
      "\"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine-platform ten. Your platform\n",
      "should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do\n",
      "they?\"\n",
      "He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over\n",
      "one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the\n",
      "middle, nothing at all.\n",
      "\"Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He\n",
      "left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All\n",
      "three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was\n",
      "he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of\n",
      "Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone.\n",
      "He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and\n",
      "three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't\n",
      "even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as\n",
      "though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for\n",
      "the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the\n",
      "end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying\n",
      "hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten\n",
      "minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he\n",
      "was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket\n",
      "full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n",
      "Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like\n",
      "tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he\n",
      "should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between\n",
      "platforms nine and ten.\n",
      "At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\n",
      "few words of what they were saying.\n",
      "66\n",
      "packed with Muggles, of course\n",

      "Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so\n",
      "did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\n",
      "\"Now, what's the platform number?\" said the boys' mother.\n",
      "“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was\n",

      "came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared\n",
      "away, the boy had vanished.\n",

      "yourself our mother? Can't you tell I'm George?\"\n",
      "\"Sorry, George, dear.\"\n",
      "\"Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin called\n",

      "almost there\n",
      "There was nothing else for it.\n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman.\n",
      "\"Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.\"\n",
      "She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and\n",
      "gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. “The thing is the thing is, I don't know how to\n",
      "\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n",
      "دو\n",
      "\"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the\n",

      "Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,\n",

      "heavy trunks.\n",
      "The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\n",
      "out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry\n",
      "pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a\n",
      "round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I've lost my toad again.\"\n",
      "“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.\n",
      "A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\n",
      "\"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\"\n",

      "shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n",
      "Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty\n",
      "compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then\n",
      "started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up\n",
      "the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his\n",
      "foot.\n",
      "\"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through\n",
      "the barrier.\n",
      "\"Yes, please,\" Harry panted.\n",
      "\"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!\"\n",
      "With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of\n",
      "the compartment.\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n",

      "man's face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing\n",

      "\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have\n",

      "Harry turned over his card and read:\n",
      "ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n",
      "CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n",
      "Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\n",

      "\"He's gone!\"\n",
      "\"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He'll be\n",
      "back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her...do you want it?\n",
      "You can start collecting.\"\n",
      "unwrapped.\n",
      "Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\n",
      "\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world,\n",
      "people just stay put in photos.\"\n",
      "\"Weird!\"\n",
      "\"Do they? What, they don't move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed.\n",
      "Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\n",
      "gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking\n",
      "at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off\n",
      "them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of\n",
      "Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his\n",
      "eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a\n",
      "bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.\n",
      "\"You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. \"When they say\n",
      "every flavor, they mean every flavor-you know, you get all the ordinary ones\n",
      "like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and\n",
      "liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\"\n",
      "Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\n",
      "\"Bleaaargh see? Sprouts.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,\n",
      "coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even\n",
      "brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which\n",
      "turned out to be pepper.\n",
      "The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The\n",
      "neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green\n",
      "hills.\n",
      "There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced\n",
      "boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked\n",
      "tearful.\n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”\n",
      "When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I've lost him! He keeps getting\n",
      "away from me!\"\n",
      "\"He'll turn up,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him...\"\n",
      "He left.\n",
      "\"Don't know why he's so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I'd brought a toad I'd\n",

      "The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.\n",
      "\"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,\" said Ron in\n",
      "disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but\n",
      "the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look...\"\n",
      "He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking\n",
      "wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\n",
      "\"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway -\"\n",
      "He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again.\n",
      "The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already\n",
      "wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n",
      "“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,” she said. She had a bossy\n",
      "sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n",
      "\"We've already told him we haven't seen it,” said Ron, but the girl\n",
      "wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n",
      "\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.\"\n",
      "She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n",
      "“Er all right.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "He cleared his throat.\n",
      "\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\n",
      "Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"\n",
      "He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "\"Are you sure that's a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it's not very good,\n",
      "is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me.\n",
      "Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my\n",

      "witchcraft there is, I've heard – I've learned all our course books by heart, of\n",
      "course, I just hope it will be enough — I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who\n",
      "are you?\"\n",
      "She said all this very fast.\n",
      "Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\n",
      "hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.\n",
      "\"I'm Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.\n",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry.\n",
      "I\n",
      "\"Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course\n",
      "got a few extra books, for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical\n",
      "History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of\n",
      "the Twentieth Century.\"\n",
      "\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed.\n",
      "\"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it\n",
      "was me,\" said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you'll be in? I've\n",
      "been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I\n",
      "hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too\n",
      "bad....Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better\n",
      "change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.\"\n",
      "And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n",
      "“Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,” said Ron. He threw his\n",
      "George gave it to me, bet he knew it\n",
      "wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell -\n",
      "was a dud.\"\n",
      "\"What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\n",
      "“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.\n",
      "\"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't\n",
      "suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\"\n",
      "\"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\"\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n",
      "\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,” said\n",
      "Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do\n",
      "now that they've left, anyway?\"\n",
      "Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.\n",
      "\"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing\n",
      "something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It's been all\n",
      "over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles\n",
      "someone tried to rob a high security vault.\"\n",
      "Harry stared.\n",
      "\"Really? What happened to them?”\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My\n",
      "dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they\n",
      "don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared\n",
      "when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it.\"\n",
      "Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle\n",
      "of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all\n",
      "part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying\n",
      "\"Voldemort\" without worrying.\n",
      "\"What's your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.\n",
      "\"Er I don't know any.\" Harry confessed.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it's the best game in\n",
      "the world\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\n",
      "positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his\n",
      "brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just\n",
      "taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door\n",
      "slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger\n",
      "this time.\n",
      "Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\n",
      "the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a\n",
      "lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.\n",
      "\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They're saying all down the train that Harry\n",
      "Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?”\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\n",
      "thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they\n",
      "looked like bodyguards.\n",
      "\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly,\n",
      "noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\"\n",
      "Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco\n",
      "Malfoy looked at him.\n",
      "\"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My\n",
      "father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than\n",
      "they can afford.\"\n",
      "He turned back to Harry. \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families\n",
      "are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the\n",
      "wrong sort. I can help you there.”\n",
      "coolly.\n",
      "He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.\n",
      "“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said\n",
      "Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\n",
      "\"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you're a bit\n",
      "politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good\n",
      "for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid,\n",
      "and it'll rub off on you.'\n",
      "دو\n",
      "Both Harry and Ron stood up.\n",
      "\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n",
      "“Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.\n",
      "\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\n",
      "Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n",
      "“But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food\n",
      "and you still seem to have some.”\n",
      "-\n",
      "Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron Ron leapt\n",
      "forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\n",
      "Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep\n",
      "into Goyle's knuckle Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\n",
      "Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit\n",
      "-\n",
      "the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there\n",
      "were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps,\n",
      "because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n",
      "\"What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the\n",
      "floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n",
      "\"I think he's been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at\n",
      "Scabbers. \"No - I don't believe it - he's gone back to sleep.\"\n",
      "And so he had.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"You've met Malfoy before?\"\n",
      "Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n",
      "\"I've heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the first\n",
      "to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been\n",
      "bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an\n",
      "excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you\n",
      "with something?”\n",
      "\"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the\n",
      "front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been\n",
      "fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!”\n",
      "\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. “Would\n",
      "you mind leaving while we change?\"\n",
      "“All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving\n",
      "very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy\n",
      "voice. \"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\"\n",
      "Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\n",
      "getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The\n",
      "train did seem to be slowing down.\n",
      "He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.\n",
      "Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\n",
      "A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five\n",
      "minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the\n",
      "school separately.\"\n",
      "Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under\n",
      "his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined\n",
      "the crowd thronging the corridor.\n",
      "The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their\n",
      "way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the\n",
      "cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and\n",

      "Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like\n",
      "Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.\n",
      "\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new ― celebrity.\"\n",
      "Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\n",
      "hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes\n",
      "were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold\n",
      "and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n",
      "“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\"\n",
      "he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word\n",
      "― like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent\n",
      "without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will\n",
      "hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty\n",
      "of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power\n",
      "of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the\n",
      "senses....I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death\n",
      "if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"\n",
      "More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks\n",
      "with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked\n",
      "desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.\n",
      "\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered\n",
      "root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"\n",
      "Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron,\n",
      "who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.\n",

      "laughter.\n",
      "\"I don't know, sir.\"\n",
      "\"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry\n",

      "everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\n",
      "ceiling.\n",
      "Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.\n",
      "\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"\n",
      "At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why\n",
      "don't you try her?”\n",
      "A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.\n",
      "Snape, however, was not pleased.\n",

      "asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the\n",
      "Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat\n",

Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\\ndrove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\\nnow reading the sign that said Privet Drive no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\\ncat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\\nlarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\n\",\n",

Mr.\\nDursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you\\nsaw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\\ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\\nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together.

It was\\na few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\\ncloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.

She told him over dinner all\\nabout Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\\nlearned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.

Harry was used to spiders, because\\nthe cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table\\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\'s birthday presents. It looked as though\\nDudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second\\ntelevision and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a\\nmystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course\\nit involved punching somebody. Dudley\\'s favorite punching bag was Harry, but\\nhe couldn\\'t often catch him. Harry didn\\'t look it, but he was very fast.\\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\\nhad always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of\\nDudley\\'s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin\\nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses\\nheld together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had\\npunched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance\\nwas a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever\\nremember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\n\"In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don\\'t ask\\nquestions.\"\\nDursleys.\\nDon\\'t ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\\n\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper\\nand shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than\\nthe rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair\\nsimply grew that way all over the place.\\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\\nmother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not\\nmuch neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on\\nhis thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\\nHarry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as\\nthere wasn\\'t much room.

       " '-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry,\\nwho could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon\\nas fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,\\n\"And we\\'ll buy you another two presents while we\\'re out today. How\\'s that,\\npopkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\"\\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said\\nslowly, \"So I\\'ll have thirty...thirty...\"\\nthen.\"\\n\"Thirty',\n",

He\\nwas ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from\\nthe telephone looking both angry and worried.\\n\"Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t\\ntake him.” She jerked her head in Harry\\'s direction.\\nDudley\\'s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\\'s heart gave a leap. Every\\nyear on Dudley\\'s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to\\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was\\nleft behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry\\nhated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him\\nlook at photographs of all the cats she\\'d ever owned.\\n\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though\\nhe\\'d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken\\nher leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year\\nbefore he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\\n\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested.\\n\"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"\\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\\'t there\\nor rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\\'t understand\\nthem, like a slug.\\n\"What about what\\'s',\n",
